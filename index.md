### Quick start to HTML

HTML is harder than Markdown, however HTML can define much more features such as `<meta>`, `<title>`, and many more blocks. It includes conventions for:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html><!--Document type-->
<!--Where content goes-->
<html>
  <head><!---Where metadata goes-->
    <title>Title to be displayed in the browser</title>
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Conapatible" content="chrome=1"><!--Where metadata goes-->
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>Div element</div>
    <h1>Headings</h1>
    <h2>1</h2>
    <h3>to</h3>
    <h4>6</h4>
  </body>
</html>
<!--
DISCLAMER: These are not the only tags. Thanks to good devolpers, there are many more!
-->
```
